# elisp-benchmarks â€” submit a PR with your own benchmark results!

This is a repo of elisp-benchmarks with native compilation run on different CPUs.

Submit an org file with your benchmark results!

1. Run the built-in Emacs `elisp-benchmarks-run` command to run the test and create the test results buffer
2. Save the buffer as `cpu-name.org` in the `cpu/` folder
3. Above the test results, Add a "specs" section with your full CPU name, OS name + major version, and Emacs version (see existing CPU org files for an example)

I am not trying to be extremely scientific by strictly controlling for all variables (OS, build flags, background services, etc). This is just meant to be fun and give us some rough perspective on how well Emacs is running with native compilation on different CPUs.

If we get lots of results, we can start organizing by OS, Emacs version, etc.
